## <a id="intro">1. Introduction</a>

NotUS is a quick and simple, Command Line Interface (CLI) based, note-taking application for keyboard-inclined users. NotUS allows for users to categorize notes by tagging as well as pinning the more important notes. NotUS is also designed to assist in planning timetables to highlight possible clashes.

This document describes the design, implementation and architecture of NotUS.

#### <a id="setup"><ins>1.1 Setting Up</ins></a>

**Prerequisites:**
* JDK 11
* IntelliJ IDE

Fork this repo and clone it onto your local machine.
Import the project as a **Gradle project**.
Ensures that you are using the correct JDK version (For this project we are using JDK 11).

<br>

## <a id="design">2. Design & Implementation</a>

This section seeks to explain the high-level design of the application. Given below is a quick overview of each component and the explanation of the design architecture in greater detail. NotUS is the main class of the application, and handles the initializing and execution of the appropriate classes. <br>
Diagrams found in our documentation were generated using <a href="https://plantuml.com/">PlantUML</a> and references were made to <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level2/tree/master/src/seedu/addressbook">addressbook-level2</a> for the structure of the classes and packages. The structures have been modified to meet the needs of our application.

#### <a id="overview"><ins>2.1 Architecture Overview</ins></a>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="NotUS Architecture Overview" src="diagrams/out/Architecture_Overview.png" />
  <br><em>Figure #</em>
</p>

The architecture design is given in the diagram above. The main components of NotUS are:

1. `InterfaceManager`: Manages the user input as well as the message output from application.
1. `ParserManager`: Creates a suitable parser, based on the command, to make sense of user message. The respective parsers then make sense of the information and calls the respective commands.
1. `Command`: Executes the necessary tasks, depending on the respective command calls .
1. `TagManager`: Stores and manages the creation and deletion of tags and other tag-related functionality.
1. `Timetable`: Stores and manages the creation and deletion of events and other event-related functionality.
1. `Notebook`: Stores and manages the creation and deletion of notes and other note-related functionality.
1. `StorageManager`: Manages the loading of existing saved files and exporting of data to human-editable files

A Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT) Chart was created prior to the start of developing NotUS and was constantly updated based on progress and updates from the development team's weekly meetings. A PERT chart is a project management tool that provides a visual representation of a project's timeline. The chart breaks down the individual tasks and aids in identifying task dependencies. A diagram of the PERT chart used for this application is shown below.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="PERT Chart" src="diagrams/out/PERT_Chart.png" />
  <br><em>Figure #</em>
</p>

#### <a id="notus"><ins>2.2 NotUS</ins></a>

NotUs manages the flow of the application. On launch, it will create the necessary components, as listed above and then attempts to load any existing saved files into the application. Subsequently, it will accept and interpret the user input and execute the commands accordingly. The diagram below depicts the main flow of the application.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="NotUS" src="diagrams/out/Notus.png" />
  <br><em>Figure #</em>
</p>

#### <a id="parserManager"><ins>2.3 ParserManager</ins></a>

The ParserManager manages the creation of specific parser objects based on the type of command. The parser then makes sense of the user input and calls the respective commands into action.

1. Receives the user input message as a whole.
1. Interprets the type of command and creates the respective parser for each command.
1. The parser then splits the message to identify all the parameters provided.
1. Creates and returns the Command class respectively.

  <br><em>Figure #</em>
</p>

ðŸ’¡ Note that the alternate paths in the sequence diagram above are not exhaustive. There is an alternate path for each unique command. As there are too many paths, they are omitted from the diagram. The Command objects in the diagram are used to represent a generic Command object that is created through the Parser. Refer to the next figure for more details.
 
 <p align="center">
   <img alt="Parser" src="diagrams/out/AddNoteParser.png" />
   <br><em>Figure #</em>
 </p>

Based on the user input, the Parser handles and creates the corresponding Command object.

#### <a id="commands"><ins>2.4 Commands</ins></a>

#### <a id="note"><ins>2.5 Notebook</ins></a>

#### <a id="event"><ins>2.6 Timetable</ins></a>

#### <a id="tag"><ins>2.7 Tags</ins></a>

The class diagram below denotes the relationship between the TagManager and the Taggable Objects (Notes and Events).

<p align="center">
   <img alt="Parser" src="diagrams/out/TaggableObject.png"/>
   <br><em>Figure #</em>
 </p>
 
Notes and Events inherit from the abstract class, TaggableObject and TagManager contains a map of individual unique
 tags to an arraylist of TaggableObjects. The TagManager handles the creation, deletion as well as the tagging and
  untagging of tags from notes or events.

#### <a id="storage"><ins>2.8 Storage</ins></a>

#### <a id="ui"><ins>2.9 User Interface</ins></a>

#### <a id="color"><ins>2.10 Usage of External Libraries</ins></a>

This application uses 2 color libraries, <a href="https://github.com/dialex/JColor">JColor</a> and <a href="https://fusesource.github.io/jansi/">Jansi</a>, to print colored messages on the terminals using ANSI escape codes. While JColor itself is sufficient to colorize the strings, Windows 10 terminal, by default, **does not support** ANSI escape code. Hence, there was a need for the Jansi library to support ANSI escape codes on Windows.
  
<ins>Note on usage of JColor library:</ins>

IntelliJ's 'Dracula' and 'High Contrast' themes print white fonts as black and vice versa. Developers using either of the themes will have to change the white and black console color to reflect the correct color that is being printed. Instructions to do so are given below.

- Go under Settings -> Editor -> Color Scheme -> Console Colors -> ANSI colors -> Change the Foreground color for Black and White to the correct RGB value.

The figure below illustrates what you should see on your screen.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Changing console color" src="diagrams/out/ConsoleColor.png" />
 <br><em>Figure #</em>
</p>

<ins>Note on usage of Jansi library:</ins>

While Jansi provides support for Windows terminal to print colored texts, it does not work within IntelliJ IDEA console. Therefore, when running on IntelliJ console, comment out the following lines in NotUS.java main function:

 `AnsiConsole.systemInstall();`
 `AnsiConsole.systemUninstall();`
 
Remember to uncomment them when building jar files for release.

**PinCommand**

1. Created by the parser function
1. Gets the note that is referenced too either by title or index 
1. Toggles the pinned status of the specified note. 
1. Returns the title as well as the pinned status of the note.
